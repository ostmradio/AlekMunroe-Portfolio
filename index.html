From developing a website to building and managing servers, and from curating the perfect playlist to editing music, I'm involved in every aspect of the station. Plus, I'm always working hard to keep our followers in the loop by writing awesome blog posts and updating our social media accounts every couple of days.

                        <p>One of the most exciting projects I've had the chance to work on was the creation of "The UNRELATED Podcast", which my college friends and I produced to be played on my radio station, OSTM Radio. Over the course of two seasons, we discussed the latest news and events happening around the world, and had some great conversations and debates along the way. It was a real team effort, and I loved being a part of something so creative and engaging. I'm proud of what we achieved with the podcast, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it might go in the future.</p>

                        <p>As part of a second-year university project, I had the opportunity to work on The Story of Kate Webster, a short narrative-driven game built in Unity. You play as Kate Webster, making choices through a branching dialogue system that influences the story's outcome. I was the lead programmer in a group of three, responsible for coding the entire game. It was challenging deciding what features to prioritize in a short development window, but I’m really proud of what I achieved.</p>

                        <p>While developing The Story of Kate Webster, I created a fully functional branching dialogue system from scratch using Unity’s xNode framework. Even though it started as part of a group project, I independently programmed and debugged the entire system. It took a lot of time and effort to add all the features and squash bugs, but I’m really happy with how it turned out. I plan to reuse and expand this system for future projects.</p>

                        <p>Wiinite started as a fun project after I was inspired by a video imagining what Fortnite would look like if it was made on the Nintendo Wii. I loved the concept so much that I decided to build my own version! The journey wasn’t easy — importing the Wuhu Island map, fixing texture issues, adding characters, and setting up emotes all had their challenges. But after a lot of trial, error, and creativity, I brought Wiinite to life. This project taught me so much about problem-solving and game development. If you want to see more about the project and its development journey, I made two videos on my YouTube channel explaining everything!</p>

                        <p>I'm excited to share that I've written a book called The Dark Lord's Reign, an epic tale set in the depths of Hell. The story follows Lucifer, the fallen angel, as he leads a coven of powerful witches on a dangerous mission to face the upcoming war against the souls of Hell. The journey is perilous, and the witches will have to push the boundaries of their beliefs and test the limits of their powers to defeat their enemies and secure their place in the underworld. With the fate of Hell hanging in the balance, Lucifer and his allies must come together to harness the power of the Grand Hall of Arcane and unleash the full extent of their magic against their foes. But with enemies at every turn and the souls of Hell determined to reign supreme, the battle won't be easy. Will they be able to overcome the challenges and emerge victorious, or will the souls of Hell succeed in their quest for ultimate power? The Dark Lord's Reign is a thrilling and action-packed adventure that I'm proud to have written and hope you enjoy reading.</p>

                        <p>During my time in college, I had the chance to take part in a fun project where we had one week to create a game based on the theme "Winter Wonderland". I teamed up with two other classmates, and my role was to program the entire game and work within the Unity game engine. We put our heads together and worked hard, and it paid off when our game scored first place in the rankings!

                        <p>As part of my Level 3 BTEC in Game Design, I had the opportunity to work with a group of talented individuals to create an awesome game. It was a steep learning curve for me, as I had to figure out how to manage a team and work together to meet some tight deadlines to create a fully functional playable demo. But with the support of my teammates and some great guidance from our tutor, we pulled it off, and I gained some valuable experience in teamwork and project management along the way.</p>

                        <p>Working with Unity Radio, a Manchester-based station that brings young people together to create a weekly radio show, was an incredible experience for me. Not only did I learn how to work more effectively in a team and gain valuable insights into the music industry, but I also got the chance to complete a two-week work experience program with them. During that time, I took on a range of responsibilities, including managing inventory, editing music to ensure it was safe for broadcast, and even working on blogs for the Unity Radio website. It was an incredible opportunity that taught me so much about working in the media, and I'm grateful for the chance to have been a part of it.</p>

                I am Alek, the founder of OSTM LTD. I have great skills in computing and coming up with new ideas for
                making games. In 2019 I worked with Unity Radio to make a radio show for youths and in the process I had made
                my own radio station called OSTM Radio where me and others run our own radio shows. In my free time I like to
                make games and work on personal projects such as working on a game called Monkey Runner (read above for more
                information) and this website. I work really hard in making sure all my projects are completed to the best of my ability.
